# Backend Setup

## Setting Django secret key
- Within the MD_Attractor/settings.py, replace the DJANGO_SECRET_KEY part with the secret key generated by you.
    ```
    SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key_here'
    ```

## Setting Spotify Credentials
- within the song_api/spotifyAPI.py, replace the client_id and client_secret_key part with the credentials generated by you.
    ```
    self.client_id = 'SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID'
    self.client_secret = 'SPOTIFY_SECRET_KEY'
    ```

## Starting Backend Server
1. Setup admin user `python manage.py createsuperuser`.
2. Start the Django server by running `python manage.py runserver`.
3. The server will be running on `http://localhost:8000'.

## Usage
1. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8000`.
2. For better visualization and testing of API endpoints, you can use Postman. Download and install Postman from [https://www.postman.com/](https://www.postman.com/).


## API Endpoints
```bash
http://localhost:8000/admin         #View Django admin panel
http://localhost:8000/              #Song Search Feature
http://localhost:8000/history       #View Search History
```

Certainly! Below is an updated section for your `README.md` that addresses the installation issue and provides a resolution.

# Installation Issue

When running `npm install`, you may encounter the following error:

```
npm error code ERESOLVE
npm error ERESOLVE could not resolve
npm error
npm error While resolving: react-vis-network@1.0.0
npm error Found: react@18.3.1
npm error node_modules/react
npm error   react@"^18.3.1" from the root project
npm error   peer react@"^18.0.0" from @testing-library/react@13.4.0
npm error   node_modules/@testing-library/react
npm error   @testing-library/react@"^13.4.0" from the root project
npm error   7 more (react-dom, react-graph-vis, react-loader-spinner, ...)
npm error
npm error Could not resolve dependency:
npm error peer react@"^16.0.0" from react-vis-network@1.0.0
npm error node_modules/react-vis-network
npm error   react-vis-network@"^1.0.0" from the root project
npm error
npm error Conflicting peer dependency: react@16.14.0
npm error node_modules/react
npm error   peer react@"^16.0.0" from react-vis-network@1.0.0
npm error   node_modules/react-vis-network
npm error   react-vis-network@"^1.0.0" from the root project
npm error
```

This error occurs because there is a conflict between the version of `react` installed in your project (`react@18.3.1`) and the peer dependency required by the `react-vis-network` package (`react@^16.0.0`).

### Resolution

To resolve this issue, use the following command to bypass the peer dependency conflict:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Explanation

- The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag tells npm to ignore the peer dependency conflicts and install the packages anyway.
- This is useful when you're working with packages that have not been updated to support the latest versions of their dependencies, or when you're using specific versions of libraries that are incompatible with the latest versions.
